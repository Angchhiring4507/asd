            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                <br>   Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
                <br>   I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
                <br>   It'll get you up and going out of bed
            </p>    

            <p>
                <br>   Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
                <br>     I been thinking of our future, 'cause I'll never see those days
                <br>    I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
                <br>     I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
            </p> 

            <p> 
                <br>   I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
                <br>  When I leave this Earth, hoping you'll find someone else
                <br>   'Cause, yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
                <br>   Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
            </p>  
             
            <p>
                <br>    I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
                <br>    I hope I go to Heaven, so I see you once again
                <br>     My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
                <br>     Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
            </p>  
             
            <p>
                <br>    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
                <br>     I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
                <br>     It'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy, ayy)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <br>     Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
                <br>     I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
                <br>     It'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)
            </p>   

            <p>
                <br>     I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
                <br>     When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
                <br>     Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
                <br>     You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
            </p>   

            <p>
                <br>     Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
                <br>     And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
                <br>     Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
                <br>     Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <br>     Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
                <br>     I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
                <br>     It'll get you up and going out of bed

                <br>     It'll get you up and going out of bed
